## Web Design Challenge

For this challenge, we were required to create a webpage for data on the correlations between latitude and weather aspects.  The first step was to establish the index.html and import bootstrap.  Bootstrap makes it much easier to develop presentable web pages and add certain attributes like navbars.  

The first page provides a synopsis and shows small pictures of all of the plots.  These images can be clickde in and take the user to a site where the picture is enlarged and the correlation is explained.  

At the top of each webpage is a navbar that can be used to take the user to all of the different pages.
